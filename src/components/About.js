                Hi, I'm Jocyline.
              </h1>
              <p className="mb-10 leading-relaxed text-justify font-serif">
                  Hello! I'm a full-stack developer who has graduated from Microverse,
                a remote software development school that uses pair programming 
                and real-world projects to teach development.
                <br/>
                While at Microverse I spent 1300+ hours mastering <span className="font-bold text-blue-900 text-opacity-100">algorithms, 
                data structures, and full-stack development </span> 
                while simultaneously 
                developing projects with <span className="font-bold text-blue-900 text-opacity-100"> Ruby, Rails, JavaScript, React, and Redux.</span>
                <br/>
                I have also developed skills in remote pair-programming using GitHub, 
                industry-standard git-flow,
                 and daily standups to communicate and collaborate with international
                  remote developers. 
                  <br/>
                  I worked at a call centre for several years before transitioning
                   into software development. The type of work was definitely different 
                   from web development, but I also learned several of the skills that 
                   Iâ€™m able to use nowadays as a developer, 
                  like <span className="font-bold text-blue-900 text-opacity-100">empathy, problem-solving, effective communication, multi-tasking, and more.</span>
